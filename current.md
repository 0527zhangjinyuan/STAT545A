### cm 01 | [Introduction to the course](2013-lectures/cm01_intro-to-course.pdf) | Wednesday Sept 04

  * Complete the Google form. JB sent a link to all registered students. If you need the link, contact her by email.
  
  * Ask to join the [STAT545A_2013 Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stat545a_2013) or play hard to get and wait for us to invite you.

  * Follow some of the links that interest you in the cm01 lecture slides (link to PDF above). Would be great if people started a thread on the Google group suggesting more or better blogs or articles hitting the same topics or pointing out broken links.
  
  * Work through
    - [Get R, RStudio, and some add-on packages set up](block00_setup.html)
    - [Basics of R/RStudio, workspaces, and projects](block01_basicsWorkspaceWorkingDirProject.html) <-- Really important that you show up Monday having completed this tutorial. Have that `toyline.R` script ready to work with.
    
  * Sign up for an account at [Rpubs.com](http://rpubs.com). We will try this as the first and gentlest method of generating finished work for this course. JB has [conducted a test](http://rpubs.com/jennybc) and it's dead easy. We'll get you started on Monday.

### cm 02 | Monday Sept 09

  * Sign up for an educational account at [github.com/edu](https://github.com/edu). **Take advantage of their special deal for students, where you can get something like 5 private repositories for two years for free.** We will experiment with students modifying [the course repository](https://github.com/jennybc/STAT545A) via a [browser-based workflow](https://github.com/blog/1557-github-flow-in-the-browser) for those who do not wish to take the git plunge yet. I will not require you to create or share your own repositories -- you just need a github account in order to edit mine, e.g. the course repository. Usage cases I have in mind:
    - Submitting coursework by adding a link to work you've published on [Rpubs.com](http://rpubs.com)
    - Suggesting a dataset to work on later in the class or commenting on suggestions made by others
    
  * Work through
    - [Basic care and feeding of data in R](block02_importInspectAccess.html)
