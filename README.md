This directory / git(hub) repository / RStudio project holds course content.

It is processed by the R package `fileherd` (still private to JB) to produce the course website:

  * [General persistent landing page for STAT 545A](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/index.html)
  * [Actively changing page for current run of STAT 545A](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/current.html)
